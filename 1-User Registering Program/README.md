## User Registering Program

This is a template based in some registering programs, but
this is crated for **Tkinter (Python)**, the desing is so simple
to understand for anyone, enjoy the program!

If you want to add more infos like: phone number, ID number
or
outhers things, you need to add more geometry to the window 
and obviosly outher entry and label.

## How this work?

Obviosly you need to open the ```Main.py``` file to start, in the
program have 3 entry boxes these are: Name, email, and Password
after this, pressing the "Ok" button, will create a window with 
the infos and create a ```.txt``` named with the user's name,
into the file has writed with Username, email and Password. And
its is all, all the python files have notes for more explanation
if you don't know what the command line do, dont worry, you can 
read the [Tkinter's Docs](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html) 
for more info.
