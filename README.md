## TKinter-Example
Hello, this project has created to help you to learn about TKinter and help if
you dont have pre-programed templates, if you want to help me I recommend you
create a fork of my project. Enjoy!

## but first...
I recomend you know a little bit about **TKinter** and **Python OOP** for 
a easily understanding of all code, and recomend you read the LICENSE file too,
but if you know about *MIT Software License* probally you dont need to read.
All the prgrams have comments, this will help to the understanding.

read here the [TKinter-Docs here](tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html)!

I'm so glad if you have watch this repository or copied, I will add more
examples when I can, a huge thanks for you! :D
