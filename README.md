## TKinter-Templates
    This is a project to help you learn to make windows tamplates 
for study or use this in your project, you are free to do it!

# but first...
    I recomend you know a little bit about TKinter and Python OOP for 
a easily understanding of all code, and recomend you read the LICENSE file too,
but if you know about MIT Software License probally you dont need to read.

    I'm so glad if you have watch this repository or copied, I will add more
tamplates when I can, big thanks for you! :D
