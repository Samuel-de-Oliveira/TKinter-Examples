## TKinter-Example
Hello, this project has created to help you to learn about TKinter and help if
you only want to see how Tkinter works, if you want to help me I recommend you
create a fork of my project.

## but first...
I recomend you know a little bit about **TKinter** and **Python OOP** for 
a easily understanding of all code, and recomend you read the LICENSE file too,
but if you know about *MIT Software License* probally you dont need to read.
All the programs have comments, this will help to the understanding.

read here the [TKinter-Docs here](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html)!

I'm so glad if you have cloned this repository, I will add more examples when I
can, a huge thanks for you and enjoy it! :D
