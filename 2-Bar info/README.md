## Bar info
This is an example based in programs like ```MS Word``` or
```LibreOffice Writer```, who show under a little bar the infos
like gramtical errors or the number of word and letters in
the document, enjoy!

If you are using the VS code you can see down a blue bar who work same, but it's
not interactive yet, but enjoy anyway.
